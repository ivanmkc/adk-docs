# Unit tests for runner.sh.
# This script can be run directly to validate the logic of the functions in runner.sh.

# --- Test Setup ---
# Source the script to make its functions available for testing.
source "$(dirname "$0")/runner.sh"

# --- Test Harness ---
# Simple assertion function to check for equality.
