# This file lists Go snippet files to be built and run by runner.sh.
# Each line represents a single build/run target.
#
# Format:
# - Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments and ignored.
# - Each non-comment line should contain one or more Go file paths,
#   relative to the 'examples/go/' directory.
# - If multiple files are on a single line, they are treated as part of the same package
#   and built/run together (e.g., for files with shared dependencies).
# - Arguments are not supported
#
# Examples:
#   # Single file example
#   snippets/quickstart/main.go
#
#   # Multiple files in a single package example
#   snippets/tools-custom/doc_analysis/main.go snippets/tools-custom/doc_analysis/doc_analysis.go
